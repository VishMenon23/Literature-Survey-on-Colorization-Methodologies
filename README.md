# Literature-Survey-on-Colorization-Methodologies

Colorization involves the task of automatically adding of colors to grayscale images and videos. This has numerous practical applications, including restoration of old photographs and movies, improvement of medical imaging, and creation of realistic animations and art. 

This literature review's goal is to examine cutting-edge methods for colorization in computer vision, including methods based on deep learning, methods based on optimization, and hybrid methods that combine these two approaches. The essential ideas and difficulties in colorization, such as color space representation, color transfer, and colorization accuracy assessment, will be covered in the survey. 

We intend to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of various colorization methods and talk about how they might be used in the arts, sciences, and other sectors. 

Overall, this literature survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in colorization in computer vision and identify the research trends and opportunities for future exploration.
